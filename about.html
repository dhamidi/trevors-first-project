<h1>About my page</h1>

<p>This is where I share my thoughts, travels, adventures and things I learn. 
Why not facebook? Because facebook is full of bullshit, that's why. It's also hard to find and keep the good stuff. 
Here is where you will get only interesting information, I will be your own personal bullshit filter.
If you like bullshit and don't like interesting things then click away and while the mouse is in your hand feel free to jam 
Them both together into your anus.</p>

<p>The website is broken into sections.</p> 

<H4><p>Music and art for the revolution (LINK) </p> </H4> <p> Here I share music and art that inspires the soul, 
makes the body move, makes you laugh, calms the nerves, tickles the intellect and/or makes you want to throw a rock into a 
cop's face. I will
also use it to show my own and my friends music and any gigs or concerts I attend. </p> 

<h4><p>Travels, adventures and stories. (LINK)</p> </h4>
<p> This is where I will be documenting my travels. You will see my best photos, stories and a slightly twisted commentary
on all things foreign. I will also leave travel rescources to help you get on your way</p>

<h4><p>Make a better world</p></h4> <p> If you're not a complete cunt you should have some sort of interest in
leaving a better world for future generations. So here is the place to learn about wholesome social movements, inspirational
people, quotes, organic farming. So put flowers in the hair, roll up a fat one, save the whales and fuck the system.
Let's try and have a solution based focus here. </p>
 
<em>I hope you enjoy and share your thoughts with me.</em>Trevor</p>
